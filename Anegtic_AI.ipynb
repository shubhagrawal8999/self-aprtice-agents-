You will use logic, a bit of math (alphabetical positions), and a touch of linguistic intuition (common letter combinations) to deduce the unique word.\n\nClues\n1) The first letter is the 13th letter of the alphabet.\n2) The middle two letters form a common English digraph: AT.\n3) The last letter is the 8th letter of the alphabet.\n4) The sum of the alphabetical positions (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26) of the four letters equals 42.\n\nDeliverables\n- Final answer: The four-letter word W.\n- Concise justification: A short, clear rationale showing how the clues lead to the answer.\n- Brief outline of an alternative solution path that yields the same conclusion: a second, distinct but equivalent reasoning route to the same final word.\n\nSolution\n\nFinal answer\nMATH\n\nConcise justification (how the clues lead to MATH)\n- Clue 1: The first letter is the 13th letter. The 13th letter is M. So w1 = M.\n- Clue 2: The middle two letters form the digraph AT. So w2 = A and w3 = T.\n- Clue 3: The last letter is the 8th letter. The 8th letter is H. So w4 = H.\n- Clue 4: Check the alphabet positions: M(13) + A(1) + T(20) + H(8) = 42, which matches the required sum.\n\nSince all four clues lock in exactly M, A, T, H, the only word that fits is MATH. The combination of logic (where clues pin down the structure), mathematics (the letter-sum check), and linguistic insight (recognizing the common digraph AT) yields a unique solution.\n\nAlternative solution path (outline)\n- Route A (direct): Use Clues 1, 2, and 3 to fix w1 = M, w2 = A, w3 = T, w4 = H immediately. Then verify with Clue 4, which indeed gives 42. This confirms MATH.\n- Route B (sum-first with a cross-check): From Clue 4, the total must be 42. Knowing w1 is M (13) and w4 is H (8) from Clues 1 and 3, we get w2 + w3 = 42 − 13 − 8 = 21. The middle two letters must form a common digraph of a two-letter sum equal to 21; the only such common digraph among English digraphs that also matches the other constraints is AT (A=1, T=20; sum 21). Therefore w2 = A, w3 = T, leading again to MATH. This route arrives at the same conclusion via a different focal point.\n\nNotes\n- The puzzle is self-contained: all data (alphabet positions and the digraph AT) are defined within the puzzle, with no need for external sources.\n- The final answer is uniquely determined by the four clues."

Each letter is derived from a distinct intellectual domain: Linguistics, Mathematics, and Logic. All necessary information is contained within this puzzle. No external resources or tools (like dictionaries, calculators, or internet searches) are required.\n\n---\n\n### Part 1: The First Letter (Linguistic Insight)\n\nConsider the following riddle:\n\"I have cities, but no houses; forests, but no trees; and water, but no fish. What am I?\"\n\nOnce you have identified the answer, take its *fourth* letter. The letter corresponding to this numerical position in the English alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26) will be the first letter of our three-letter word.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: The Second Letter (Mathematical Calculation)\n\nObserve the following sequence of numbers:\n1, 2, 4, 7, 11, X\n\nDetermine the value of X. This value, when converted to its corresponding letter in the English alphabet (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26), will be the second letter of our three-letter word.\n\n---\n\n### Part 3: The Third Letter (Logical Deduction)\n\nFour distinct letters (R, S, T, U) are arranged in a line, each occupying a unique position from left to right. Deduce their exact order based on these clues:\n\n1.  S is immediately to the right of R.\n2.  T is not at either end of the arrangement.\n3.  U is somewhere to the left of S.\n\nThe letter found in the *second* position of this arrangement will be the third letter of our three-letter word.\n\n---\n\n### Required Deliverables:\n\n1.  **The final three-letter word.**\n2.  **A concise justification for each step** (for Part 1, 2, and 3) leading to the individual letters.\n3.  **A brief outline of an alternative solution path** that yields the same conclusion for at least two of the puzzle's parts.\n\n---\n\n## Solution\n\n### 1. The Final Three-Letter Word:\n\n**PPT**\n\n### 2. Concise Justification:\n\n*   **Part 1: Linguistic Insight (First Letter)**\n    *   The riddle \"I have cities, but no houses; forests, but no trees; and water, but no fish. What am I?\" describes a **MAP**.\n    *   The fourth letter of \"MAP\" is **P**.\n    *   P is the 16th letter of the alphabet. Therefore, the first letter of the solution is **P**.\n\n*   **Part 2: Mathematical Calculation (Second Letter)**\n    *   The sequence is 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, X.\n    *   By finding the differences between successive terms:\n        *   2 - 1 = 1\n        *   4 - 2 = 2\n        *   7 - 4 = 3\n        *   11 - 7 = 4\n    *   The differences form an arithmetic progression (1, 2, 3, 4). The next difference must be 5.\n    *   Therefore, X = 11 + 5 = 16.\n    *   The 16th letter of the alphabet is **P**. Therefore, the second letter of the solution is **P**.\n\n*   **Part 3: Logical Deduction (Third Letter)**\n    *   Let the four positions be denoted by `_ _ _ _`.\n    *   From Clue 1: S is immediately to the right of R. This means we have a fixed block \"RS\". Possible arrangements: `RS _ _`, `_ RS _`, `_ _ RS`.\n    *   From Clue 3: U is somewhere to the left of S. Since S is part of the \"RS\" block, U must be to the left of the entire \"RS\" block.\n        *   If `RS _ _`, then U must be before R, i.e., `U RS _`. The last position must be T. So `URST`.\n        *   If `_ RS _`, then U must be before R, i.e., `U RS _`. The last position must be T. So `URST`. (Same as above)\n        *   If `_ _ RS`, then U must be in the first or second position.\n            *   If U is first: `U _ RS`. The second position must be T. So `UTRS`.\n            *   If U is second: `_ U RS`. This is not possible because R must be immediately left of S, so `R` would have to be in the first position, leaving no room for `U` before `RS`.\n    *   So, the only two candidate arrangements are `URST` and `UTRS`.\n    *   From Clue 2: T is not at either end of the arrangement.\n        *   In `URST`, T is at the last position (an end). This arrangement is invalid.\n        *   In `UTRS`, T is in the second position (not an end). This arrangement is valid.\n    *   Therefore, the correct arrangement is **UTRS**.\n    *   The letter in the *second* position is **T**. Therefore, the third letter of the solution is **T**.\n\n### 3. Brief Outline of Alternative Solution Paths:\n\nWhile the overall puzzle structure dictates which domain solves for which letter, alternative approaches can be used within individual parts:\n\n*   **Part 2: Mathematical Calculation (Second Letter)**\n    *   **Original Path:** Identifying the pattern in successive differences (1, 2, 3, 4, then 5).\n    *   **Alternative Path:** Deriving a general formula for the sequence.
